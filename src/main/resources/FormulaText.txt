STATIC EQUILIBRIUM FORMULAS

    1. Equilibrium Conditions:
       • Sum of forces: ∑F = 0 (vector sum)
       • Sum of torques: ∑τ = 0 (around any point)

    2. Component Equilibrium:
       • Horizontal: ∑Fx = 0
       • Vertical: ∑Fy = 0

    3. Gravitational Force:
       • Fg = mg
       • where m = mass, g = gravitational acceleration

    4. Normal Force on Horizontal Surface:
       • N = mg (without other vertical forces)

    5. Normal Force on Inclined Plane (angle θ):
       • N = mg·cos(θ)

    6. Static Friction Force:
       • Fs ≤ μs·N (inequality - only as much as needed for equilibrium)
       • Fs = μs·N (maximum value)
       • where μs = coefficient of static friction

    7. Kinetic Friction Force:
       • Fk = μk·N
       • where μk = coefficient of kinetic friction

    8. Tension in Strings/Ropes:
       • Tension is equal throughout massless string
       • Direction is along the string

    9. Forces on Inclined Plane (angle θ):
       • Component of gravity parallel to plane: Fg,∥ = mg·sin(θ)
       • Component of gravity perpendicular to plane: Fg,⊥ = mg·cos(θ)

    10. Two-Body Equilibrium with Pulley:
        • Tension is equal on both sides of an ideal pulley
        • For masses m₁ and m₂: T = (2·m₁·m₂·g)/(m₁+m₂)

    11. Net Force Vector:
        • Fx,net = ∑Fx
        • Fy,net = ∑Fy
        • |F|net = √(Fx,net² + Fy,net²)

    12. Torque:
        • τ = r × F = |r|·|F|·sin(θ)
        • where r = position vector, F = force vector

    13. Rotational Equilibrium:
        • ∑τclockwise = ∑τcounterclockwise

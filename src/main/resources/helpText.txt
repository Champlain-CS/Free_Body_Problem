Thank you for using the Free Body Problem Simulator!

There are certain key commands that you can use to interact with the simulator. Here are some of the most important ones:
I = Information
D = Delete Mode
R = Reset
M = Menu
V = Vectors Mode
You may also use the integrated Buttons around the screen to perform these actions.

There are also some other quirks and features that you should be aware of:
- To snap two objects you must drag the red handles on either side of the object.
- To unsnap two objects you must drag the body of the object away from the other object.
- When in display Vectors Mode you may not edit the system, you must exit the mode to edit the system.
- The simulator will not automatically save your system when you exit the program.

Enjoy your time using the Free Body Problem Simulator!
